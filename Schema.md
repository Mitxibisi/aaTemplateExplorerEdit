aaTemplateExtract XML Schema
============================

I currently don't have a proper schema for the XML output, 
but I wanted to start putting the revision numbers here so that 
anyone using the application can know what's changed as I update the application.

Can also be found in [aatemplateData.vb]((/aaTemplateExtract/aaTemplateData.vb)
